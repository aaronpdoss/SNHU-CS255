This repository consists of work completed for the course Systems analysis and Design.

Overview:
DriverPass was a theoretical system for helping student drivers study for, practice, and pass their driving exams. This was through the use of practice tests, scheduled driving lessons, and learning materials provided through different packages the students could select on the DriverPass website.

What I did particularly well with:
I feel like overall my ability to breakdown complex ideas and technical language into easy  to understand and deliverable presentations to a non-technical audience was something I did well at throughout this class.

One change to these documents:
One edit I would make to these documents would be in the systems design document. Going back and editing my diagrams to ensure they are clearer and presented better would be something  I would like to change.

How did I interpret the user's needs an dimplement them into the systemm? Why is this important to consider:
As someone who has been in situations where I was using online platforms like this I could see the needs from my own perspective. Things that I as a prospective user would like to see in a system like this were prospects I tried to address when designing the system. The users from DriverPass were a little easier to address as we were provided an interview to guage what they wanted out of the system.

How did I approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would I use inn the future to analyze and design a system:
Viewing thee system through functional and non-functional requirements was very helpful to me when designing the system. All of the diagrams I created also helped broaden the overall picture of what the system was meant to do/accomplish also drastically helped me when designing. As this was the case, in the future I would ensure that the diagrams I create for any systems I were to develop are clear and concise. This will ensure that those reading the documents clearly understand what it is depicting.
